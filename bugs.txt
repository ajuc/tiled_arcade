 - BUG-0 sometimes objects can penetrate into walls (on corners)
 - BUG-1 game is "saved" to incorrect state when exiting from page when in menu -
	should only save game when in game screen, not in menu
 - BUG-2 games freezes when loading game on firefox (shows screen without objects) (possibly a consequence of BUG-1)

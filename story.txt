[INTRO]

Grandpa:
	Ok, so I'll tell you the story. You should know, and pass this to your kids. I'm old, can die any day now.

Yacek:
	Grandpa!

Grandpa:
	It was interesting time to live. Once in the known history
regular people had such power. Power to kill the whole Earth population on a whim.

	People weren't really thinking about it that way. At least at first. It was all about
the freedom of speech, the right to communicate, and the ultimate humanitarian right - to copy.

	Gray, long-bearded prophets of free software and nerdy teenagers - nobody thought about them
as a serious political force, until 2012. Yet somehow they became one. And they won their war againist copyright.
Information really wants to be free, I guess.

	By the time hackers won, everybody was on their side. World was preparing for the incoming
age of prosperity, that the free information will bring. I thought so, too. We were all so naive.
3d printers, independent manufacturing, that was just the begining.

Yacek:
	Then the plague happened?

Grandpa:
	Yes. It was inevitable. We just couldn't see that then.

Yacek:
	Why? Hackers created the plague? Harold told me you were a hacker, so it's also your fault..

Grandpa:
	Harold is stupid. Hackers weren't some group with clear agenda. Anybody did, what he wanted.
	And I don't know who created this particular plague.

Yacek:
	There were more plagues?

Grandpa:
	Yeah, tousands, if not millions. This one was just the most effective attempt.
	It doesn't really matter, who created it. When molecular assemblers were invented,
	and then available as schema for your desk 3d printer, it was only a matter of time.
	People started doing anything with them. Governments wanted to stop that. People printed bombs,
	plastic guns, rogue computing devices.

	Do you know that 2 years after this invention we had like 10 working drugs for cancer?
	People tested drugs on themselves, when they lost hope. And surprise, surprise - out of milions
	of tries some drugs actually worked. It was the greatest moment in the mankind history.

Yacek:
	This cancer - was it worse than plague?

Grandpa:
	It was different - cancer killed mostly old people, and it took few years to do so.
	But it was often fatal, and people thought then, that we can make everybody live forever.
	So it seemed like important thing to do. The drugs for cancer was the greatest human
	inventions, it took decades of work of millions people all around the world.

	The drug for plague was piece of cake compared to drugs for cancer.

Yacek:
	If the plagues was so easy to cure, why nobody did it!? Why so many people had to die?

Grandpa:
	The problem with plague was - it gave no warnings, no signs that something is wrong.
	Everybody was infected for a few weeks, and nobody even knew it's there. So nobody worked on the cure.
	And then someone pushed the button, plague activated, and 90% of people were dead during the first hour.
	The cure was ready next day. But in the meantime nukes started raining. And here we are.

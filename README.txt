Ideas:

1.	There are a few kinds of volume-filler parameters. Each set of
parameters is named. So there is
"near_ground_air", and "stratosphere_air" and "water" and "space vacuum".

Maybe I'll invent some more.

Each set of parameters will have information about
gravitation, drag, temperature, voltage, temperatureConductivity, voltageConductivity,
and a few others
